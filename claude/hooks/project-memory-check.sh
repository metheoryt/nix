# Claude Code SessionStart hook — load (or offer to start tracking) repo-local
# memory.
#
# Fires at the start of every session, only when cwd is inside a git repo. Two
# mutually-exclusive behaviors:
#   1. <repo>/.claude/memory/project.md EXISTS → inject its contents as session
#      context. This is the LOADER: it's what makes per-repo memory merge with
#      the global + per-host memory that claude/CLAUDE.md already @imports, with
#      zero per-repo wiring (no @import needed in the repo's own CLAUDE.md).
#   2. It does NOT exist → ask Claude ONCE to OFFER the user to start tracking
#      repo-local memory (create the file, git-add it). The hook itself never
#      creates anything — it only adds guidance to the session.
#
# Per-repo opt-out: an empty .claude/memory/.skip file silences the case-2 nudge
# permanently for that repo. Stays completely silent outside a git repo.

This repository ($root) has no repo-local Claude memory yet
(.claude/memory/project.md). Repo-local memory is git-tracked inside the repo and
auto-loaded at session start (merged with the user's global + per-host memory), so
durable project-specific facts — conventions, gotchas, decisions, constraints —
survive across sessions and machines. Ask the user ONCE, early, whether they'd
like to start tracking it for this repo. If they say yes:
  - create .claude/memory/project.md with a short topical starter (one bullet per
    fact under '##' headings; no secrets);
  - confirm it isn't gitignored, then 'git add' it so it's version-controlled;
  - record per-project memories there from now on (instead of the harness's
    default per-project memory dir).
Do NOT create the file without their explicit confirmation. If they decline, drop
the topic for this session — they can create an empty .claude/memory/.skip file
in the repo to silence this nudge permanently for this repo.
