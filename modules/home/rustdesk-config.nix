# window geometry, last-connect, direct_failures, etc. — so we can't manage them
# as read-only Home-Manager symlinks (RustDesk would fail to write). Instead this
# is a SEED-ONLY activation script: it drops each file only when it's absent
# (fresh machine / wiped config) and never touches one RustDesk already owns.
